      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Infrastructure",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository setup task into frontend setup, backend setup, and deployment configuration subtasks with detailed steps for each environment",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (React, TypeScript, Node.js) and environments (Vercel, Railway/Heroku) with security considerations and monitoring setup. The cyclomatic complexity is moderate as there are several independent paths to configure."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Quiz Engine with Dynamic Question Flow",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the quiz engine implementation into data model creation, state management, UI components, and conditional logic subtasks with specific deliverables for each",
      "reasoning": "This task has high cyclomatic complexity due to the branching logic, multiple question types, and state management requirements. The conditional paths and validation rules increase the complexity score significantly."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate OpenAI API for Policy Generation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the OpenAI integration into API communication layer, prompt engineering, and error handling/fallback mechanism subtasks with specific implementation details",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with error handling, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms. The complexity is elevated due to security concerns, token optimization, and caching requirements."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Real-time Policy Preview Pane",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the preview pane development into renderer component, real-time update mechanism, and navigation/interaction features with acceptance criteria for each",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity with real-time updates and interactive elements, but follows a more linear implementation path compared to the quiz engine. The synchronization requirements add some complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Document Generation and Download",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide document generation into PDF generation, DOCX creation, and download/delivery mechanism subtasks with performance benchmarks for each format",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple document formats and libraries (Puppeteer, docx) with optimization requirements. The queuing system and error handling for document generation add significant complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create In-Browser Policy Editor",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the editor implementation into rich text component integration, auto-save functionality, and version history/preview features with specific user interactions",
      "reasoning": "This task requires integration of a complex third-party editor component with auto-save and version history. The complexity is moderate as the core functionality is provided by the editor library."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Lead Capture and Email Delivery System",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down lead capture into user data collection, email delivery system, and CRM integration subtasks with compliance requirements for each component",
      "reasoning": "This task involves personal data handling with compliance requirements, external email service integration, and CRM webhooks. The security and privacy considerations increase the complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Admin Dashboard and Analytics",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the admin dashboard into authentication system, data visualization, content management, and user management subtasks with security requirements for each",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to authentication, role-based access control, and multiple management interfaces. The analytics and A/B testing tools add significant complexity to the implementation."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Edge Cases",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split error handling into session management, service failure recovery, and security validation subtasks with test scenarios for each edge case",
      "reasoning": "This task involves handling multiple failure modes and edge cases across the application. The cyclomatic complexity is high due to the numerous error paths and recovery mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Accessibility and Performance Optimizations",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down optimization into accessibility compliance, frontend performance, and backend/database optimization subtasks with specific metrics for each area",
      "reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive accessibility implementation (WCAG 2.1 AA) and performance optimizations across the full stack. The technical depth and breadth of optimizations create high complexity."
